          >Skate Haarlem is a website that was created in the fall of 2023 by
          Ruben Yanez, a Dutch-American student at Inholland Hogeschool Haarlem.
          He hopes to get more people interested in his passion.</p1

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p2
          >Bring skateboarding and its footprint in Haarlem to the attention of
          international students in the area. in many ways, skateboarding has a
          lot of potential to be bigger than it is. It is a fun and healthy
          activity that I think many would like to learn how to do, but
          unfortunately many shy away from it because of the intimidation that
          comes along with A) the sometimes-judgemental community, and B) the
          risk factor of it, whether it be because of stories these students
          have heard of people injuring themselves or videos they see on the
          internet. My goal is to lessen these fears and inspire people to get
          on the board, as well as get to know Haarlem better and even see it in
          a new light.</p2
