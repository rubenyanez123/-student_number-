        When you start skateboarding, it is important to have the right gear,
        including safety gear, to protect yourself from falls. And yes, I know
        what you’re thinking. I know it looks cooler to not wear it, since many
        pro skaters don’t, but ask yourself this: As a beginner, would I rather
        look cool and risk getting hurt, or is sacrificing the cool factor worth
        it to keep myself safe?

            - Your brain is a vital organ. If you are a beginner, you are more
            likely to hurt your head
          </p>

          <p>
            - A bad enough blow to the head could threaten or take your life,
            which is pretty bad if you ask me. So wear a helmet.

          >When you are more experienced and know how to fall “correctly”,
          safety gear is not as important, but as a beginner, the better idea is
          to wear it. You will need:</b

      <p>
        <b>- Helmet: </b>This is the most important piece of gear, since head
        injuries are the most important to avoid. Your brain is a vital organ,
        and hurting it even a little bit can have permanent consequences, such
        as impaired movement, thinking, and emotions. In extreme cases, repeated
        blows to the head can even result in Hemorrhage and/or CTE. As a
        beginner, you are very prone to head injuries. So wear a helmet.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        <b>- Knee Pads: </b>Although not as important as a helmet, it is still a
        smart choice to protect your knees from potential sprains, breaks, or
        fractures. A bad enough blow to the knee could really shake your
        confidence in getting back on the board. Not absolutely necessary, but
        definitely recommended.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        <b>- Elbow Pads: </b>Just like knee pads, elbow pads are important for
        the same reasons. Even though your elbows are not as important as your
        knees when it comes to pushing, cruising, and doing tricks, they are an
        important in keeping your arm intact, and your arms are important for
        balance. Wrist guards: Wrist fractures are no fun, which I know from
        personal experience. I recommend these since the novice skater often
        breaks their fall with their wrists.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        <b>- Skate Shoes: </b>Technically you can skateboard in any shoe, but a
        sturdy and flat-soled one that is built specifically for skateboarding
        is often the way to go. Skate shoes are built so that A: your feet don’t
        slip off the grip tape while you are riding, and B: to maximize your pop
        (jump height) when doing tricks.
