            Once you feel comfortable cruising around and maybe even have
            learned a trick or two, you might feel ready to take on the big bad
            skate park. Riding around in one for the first time can be a
            nightmare, since it can be filled with intimidating teenagers and
            whatnot. You may find yourself ridden with anxiety and think
            everyone is looking at you and judging you, but knowing the proper
            etiquette, you can relieve yourself from a decent share of this.

            - Look both ways before crossing and wait your turn. After going to
            said skate park regularly, you will learn where the unwritten lanes
            are.

            >This all may seem scary at first, and honestly, it will be. But at
            the end of the day, it is just another fear to conquer. Stress not
            though, since these rules are naturally learned over time. If you
            are a newbie who breaks one of these rules, people may be initially
            annoyed at first, but may be more understanding after you or
            something you do indicates that you are in fact new to skate parks.
            Another bottom line that goes back to a previous point: NOBODY
            CARES! Skateboarding is an individual thing, and people don’t gawk
            at you nearly as much as you think they do. Just skate.</strong
