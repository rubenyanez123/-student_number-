            Once you feel comfortable cruising around and maybe even have
            learned a trick or two, you might feel ready to take on the big bad
            skate park. Riding around in one for the first time can be a
            nightmare, since it can be filled with intimidating teenagers and
            whatnot. You may find yourself ridden with anxiety and think
            everyone is looking at you and judging you, but knowing the proper
            etiquette, you can relieve yourself from a decent share of this.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p><b>Think of the Skate Park the Same Way You Would A Street:</b></p>
          <br />

          <p>
            - Look both ways before crossing and wait your turn. After going to
            said skate park regularly, you will learn where the unwritten lanes
            are.
            <p>- Don’t “snake” people. (snake,<i> (v). taking your turn at the same
              time as somebody else and intercepting their path.)</i></p> 
            <p>- When
            somebody’s board shoots out from under their feet towards you, you
            yell “board!”, stop their board, and return it to them.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This all may
            seem scary at first, and honestly, it will be. But at the end of the day, it
            is just another fear to conquer. Stress not though, since these
            rules are naturally learned over time. If you are a newbie who
            breaks one of these rules, people may be initially annoyed at first,
            but may be more understanding after you or something you do
            indicates that you are in fact new to skate parks. Another bottom
            line that goes back to a previous point: NOBODY CARES! Skateboarding
            is an individual thing, and people don’t gawk at you nearly as much
            as you think they do. Just skate.</p>
